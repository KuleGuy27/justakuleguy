* Preserving/Ripping my ENTIRE Physical Media Collection

# I like to preserve a lot of things and over this summer, I decided to preserve my entire physical media collection because I was bored and because physical media can be prone to wear and decay. Saying is easier than doing however, because I have hundreds of physical media so it will take time. I made this video to show how easy it is to preserve, rip, archive your media, and I hope you enjoy the video.
