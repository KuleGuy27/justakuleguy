* Completing: A good tower for Sajonara 2! All 278 Stages!

# Game name: [ROBLOX] [🎮] A good tower for Sajonara 2
Game link: https://www.roblox.com/games/101600476327892/A-good-tower-for-Sajonara-2
OS: Linux Mint 22.2

I've seen this game popup a ton on YT Shorts due to the "Skyfall Trend". The trend was basically jump down from the top while the song 'Fall From the Sky Pt.2 by Romance Planet' plays. There were countless people lying and saying "this took me 2 hours to complete" when they really just hit the big red button on the side that teleported them to the top. In this stream, I try to complete the tower through all 278 stages without hitting the button. Based on my math, the tower should take around 1 hour and 32 minutes to complete.
