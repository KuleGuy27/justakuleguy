* ROBLOX +1 Speed Motorcycle Escape! (World 2)

# Uploaded this as a short because I didn't want to upload this as a video. Had to scale down the game window to fit it in short format. Same game as last time, but except that this is world 2. The ending seems incomplete. There is an invisible wall and an unfinished road asset at the bottom. I spent so many days and so many robux to boost my speed for THAT. :/ Also Happy Valentines day I guess.
