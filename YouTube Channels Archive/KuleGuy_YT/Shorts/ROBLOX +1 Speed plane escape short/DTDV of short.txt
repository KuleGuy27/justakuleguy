* ROBLOX +1 Speed Plane Escape!

# Uploaded this as a short because I didn't want to upload this as a video. Had to scale down the game window to fit it in short format. Had to speed the video up to fit under 3 minutes. Holy crap is this game long. The hardest stage for me was Stage 9, I just kept dying until I realized that you just spam your spacebar to conserve your fuel to get to the other side. Also, I can't believe when I saw it, but I was the 4th player in the fastest speeds leaderboard! I left my laptop on for so long to grind this game lol.
