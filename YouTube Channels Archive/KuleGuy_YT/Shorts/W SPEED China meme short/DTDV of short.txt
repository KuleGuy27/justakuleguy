* WSPEED in China ❤️‍🩹 #ishowspeed #wspeed #edit #memes

# Stupid meme I made for Valentine's Day. Sorry if the edit kinda sucks. I couldn't figure out how to do motion blur in Kdenlive :/

This was from a stream of when Speed was touring Shanghai China and found Chinese newlyweds together on "The Bund promenade". Was pretty nice of him to take their photo for them! Speed breathes air, W SPEED.

Here is the stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK85SQzm0Z0?t=12471.
The moment appears at 3:27:51 btw.

The song name is blue - yung kai (slowed): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnL6PJM5TNo
