* My sisters got these from Costco - Nutty Fruity Dubai Chocolate Bars!

# I've eaten Dubai chocolate before and it was pretty good. My sisters got these from Costco when we went with family. They didn't tell me until I noticed the bag at home. These chocolates are individually wrapped in gold looking plastic and sometimes the chocolate inside melts a little. Finally, some good f**king food.
