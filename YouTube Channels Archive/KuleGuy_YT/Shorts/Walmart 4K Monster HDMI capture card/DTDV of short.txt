* I got a new HDMI capture card! (Walmart 4K Monster)

Well technically my dad bought it for me but whatever.
This short is NOT sponsored btw. I rate it a 6.7/10, the card is kinda mid.

You can find the product here: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Monster-4K-Black-Audio-Video-USB-3-0-HDMI-Capture-Card-Record-High-Quality-Videos-Live-Stream/5550338999
