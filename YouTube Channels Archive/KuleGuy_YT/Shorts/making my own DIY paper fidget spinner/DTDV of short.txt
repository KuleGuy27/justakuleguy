* Making my own paper fidget spinner (old video)

# Old video that I had saved on my phone that I uploaded to Instagram reels one time when I had Instagram. My phone says this video was made on the 3rd of April 2023.

Here is the link to the video I was watching on my computer at the time (deleted): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPV_5IjFu5o
The video was deleted alongside with the channel, their socialblade stopped counting near the end of January 2025: https://socialblade.com/youtube/custom/lhacktv2101
