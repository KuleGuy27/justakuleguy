* ROBLOX [UPD2] +1 Speed Keyboard Escape!

# Uploaded this as a short because I didn't want to upload this as a video. Had to scale down the game window to fit it in short format. This game has no music, just keyboard ASMR which is pretty nice since I don't have to worry about copyright this time. This is the 3rd game that has more coming soon when I reach the end. I wonder was else is next when they update the game? Sorry for the weird cut at 1:39, I just fell down accidentally but got back up again after a few seconds later.
