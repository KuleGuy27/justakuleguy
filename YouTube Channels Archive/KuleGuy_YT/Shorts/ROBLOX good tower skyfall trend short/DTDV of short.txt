* roblox skyfall trend but I actually did it #roblox #skyfalltrend

# CALIFORNIA TO THE SKY

I was scrolling YT shorts one day and I stumbled upon a trend called the "skyfall trend" where people play this one ROBLOX tower game, "climb" to the top, and jump down while the song 'Fall From the Sky Pt by Romance Planet' plays. Many people were lying and said "this took me 2 hours to complete" when actually, there is a button that teleports you to the top. Based on my math, it should take you around 1 hour and 32 minutes to complete the tower with no breaks.

The song is Fall From The Sky Pt.2 by Romance Planet - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCD_0v1V7tQ

I did all of this on my livestream yesterday. It felt like forever... https://www.youtube.com/live/D_Vn1QXI4EY
