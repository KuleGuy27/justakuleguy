Everytime I make a new post on YouTube:
- download the image(s) and put it in the folder
- copy and past the previous post
- get the date and time (1 January 2025) and add it in the html
- get the link of the post and link it on the date
- text of the post and links (a href if possible) and add in the html
- add the photos in the html
- add slideshows and change the id if possible
