* ROBLOX Frutiger Aero Tower - All 6 Levels!

# A cool obby game I found on ROBLOX. I don't really know what to post on Christmas Day, my mind is blank, I have no ideas, but I just spent hours playing and recording this game yesterday so I might as well post this. Probably my last upload of 2025...
I filmed this gameplay on my new HDMI Monster 4K capture card that I got from Walmart and it records in 1080P 60FPS well, but it sometimes freeze frame and I have to restart my gameplay because I forget to notice it.
