* Osu Android - Hidamari No Uta by Hatsune Miku (DJ'TEKINA//SOMETHING remix)

# MIKU LÀ NHẤT

I filmed this yesterday on the 10th of May. My cousin just graduated from college and we decided to celebrate by going to a buffet. I filmed this on my Sony DSC-H70 camera and I wore my bluetooth earbuds to listen to the song. Bluetooth on Osu sucks, it has delays and I genuinely can't recommend it, that's why I suck at hitting the circles here.
