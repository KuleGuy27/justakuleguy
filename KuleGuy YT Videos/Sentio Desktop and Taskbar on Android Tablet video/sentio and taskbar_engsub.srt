00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:01,114
For the past few months,

2
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:05,693
I've been trying to use my Samsung Galaxy Tab A T510 as a computer,

3
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:07,787
and it's something that has intrigued me since.

4
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:09,706
Now I do have have laptop that I use,

5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,987
but my problem is that my laptop is big

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,968
and that the battery dies after a few minutes.

7
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:15,655
Android tablets are smaller,

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,090
they can fit on a crowded desk

9
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:18,260
you can carry them anywhere,

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,235
and the battery is decent because the OS isn’t that demanding.

11
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,152
And because of that,

12
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:23,664
I’ve been trying to use my tablet

13
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:27,156
kinda like a Microsoft Surface for doing my school work without hassle.

14
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,157
In front of me here is my Android tablet with it’s case,

15
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:32,746
along with my bluetooth keyboard and mouse.

16
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:36,272
My peripherals are fine, and I haven’t had any problems with it,

17
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:36,946
YET

18
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,550
But what about the operating system or software?

19
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:40,762
Android is fine,

20
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,221
but it doesn't work as a desktop-like multitasking experience which I want.

21
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:48,020
I could use my laptop as a remote desktop,

22
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,807
but that’s slow and not reliable.

23
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,933
Samsung Dex exists, it’s a really cool feature,

24
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,239
but it only works for supported devices.

25
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:57,378
Fortunately, I do have a solution,

26
00:00:57,403 --> 00:01:01,184
and that is to use Sentio Desktop (formerly Andromium OS)

27
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,043
or Taskbar by Braden Farmer.

28
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,722
Starting of with Sentio Desktop.

29
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:08,964
I found Sentio Desktop because I was looking for a Samsung Dex alternative

30
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:12,539
that works on my tablet by this YouTuber named: Eevnos.

31
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,148
From what I could gather online,

32
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,925
Sentio Desktop was made by Andromium Inc.

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,050
with Andrew Jiang as the Co-founder and CEO.

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,479
"Oh hi, I'm Luke."

35
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:23,508
Yo, his names Luke, just like me!

36
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,747
Before this, they made an app on the Play Store as Andromium OS

37
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:32,935
but then changed their name to Sentio Desktop because people kept misspelling Andromium.

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,149
"Did you say Sentium, isn't it Andromium?"

39
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,074
"So, Sentio is the new company name."

40
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,258
"We actually rebranded a couple months ago,"

41
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:43,246
"mostly because people were spelling Andromium not right all the time."

42
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:46,163
Anyways, Sentio desktop is pretty much like Samsung Dex

43
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:49,341
where you use your phone and plug it into a laptop or computer

44
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:52,521
and it transforms into a desktop-like interface.

45
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,759
Sentio Desktop was made to be used with their product called ‘The Superbook'

46
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,274
which has around $3,000,000 on Kickstarter.

47
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:03,145
This reminds me of Linus Tech Tips video on the NexDock 2

48
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:06,370
and he also mentioned Sentio in the video, nice.

49
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,054
Now you don't need the Superbook,

50
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:10,087
you can just use the app by itself

51
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:13,138
and it will transform itself without needing anything else.

52
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:16,806
Unfortunately, I could not find Sentio Desktop on the Play Store anymore,

53
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,839
but there are apks of it online.

54
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,853
The last apk was from 2018 and nothing since, how sad.

55
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:24,350
When you first start the app,

56
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,669
it gives you the option to pair with the superbook,

57
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,215
overlay permissions,

58
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,372
a short tutorial,

59
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,450
and then more permissions.

60
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:45,257
Finally, you get to Sentio Desktop.

61
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:45,889
Right here,

62
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:48,199
you have the taskbar with your settings to the right,

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,629
app list, and icons on the desktop.

64
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,070
If you want, you can press on the tutorial

65
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,543
and it takes to their Medium.com page.

66
00:02:55,568 --> 00:03:01,041
This is where Jesse Sum highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the Sentio desktop,

67
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,045
pretty cool.

68
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,519
Pressing on ‘logout Sentio’ quits the app,

69
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:07,930
and ‘DPI tutorial’ shows you how to change the scaling.

70
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:10,644
What’s pretty weird is that to show apps on the taskbar,

71
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,390
you click on the settings icon,

72
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,047
sentio settings,

73
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:18,047
and then enable recent apps because it’s not enabled by default.

74
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,699
Find Sentio...

75
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:21,012
Ok turn that on.

76
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,773
To pin apps to the taskbar,

77
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:26,656
you right click (or hold) and click “pin to taskbar”.

78
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:32,613
A problem I have with Sentio Desktop is that the recent apps on the taskbar don't update live,

79
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:37,374
so you always have to close Sentio Desktop and reopen it again.

80
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:40,601
The same thing happens with the battery indicator on the taskbar,

81
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,976
it doesn't update live.

82
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:43,297
Speaking of the taskbar,

83
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:45,620
you can view your bluetooth connections,

84
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,483
wifi,

85
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:47,808
turn down your volume,

86
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,400
access quick settings,

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,390
notifica-

88
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,678
notifications,

89
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,542
raise the taskbar up and down,

90
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:54,970
exit Sentio,

91
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:00,394
and the time in the corner opens your calendar app.

92
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:01,428
Really neat!

93
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,591
Remember right clicking or holding?

94
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,864
You can make an app open in a:

95
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,809
normal,

96
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,700
maximized,

97
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:11,579
and left and right of the screen.

98
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:14,274
You can open in fullscreen,

99
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,880
and also uninstall an app all in Sentio.

100
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,473
When pressing and holding an app,

101
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,946
you can move it to the desktop and move it around,

102
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,415
just like a Windows computer.

103
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,977
The app is pretty simple and easy to use

104
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,712
and I've used it for most of my tasks at school.

105
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:30,325
Sentio Desktop could access my Android apps,

106
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,344
my files,

107
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,544
and it could most importantly multitask.

108
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,051
I liked that it opened an app in windowed mode everytime,

109
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:40,477
 and for apps like ROBLOX where it opens in full screen,

110
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,848
you can go to the developer options and turn on ‘force apps to be resizeable’.

111
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,950
That being said, it’s far from perfect.

112
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:49,692
Because the app hasn’t been updated in 7 years,

113
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:52,637
there’s not a lot of features to it and there are things that annoy me.

114
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:54,082
Like I said before,

115
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:56,118
the recent apps don’t update live.

116
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,215
I checked the blog post in their medium page and apparently

117
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,567
the apps don’t update live because Android doesn’t allow the functionality anymore.

118
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:06,481
Right clicking the desktop only brings up two options.

119
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,766
Ok let me change...

120
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,500
Ok just, takes you to the app.

121
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,364
When having multiple windows,

122
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:16,812
clicking the ‘X’ button minimizes an app and puts it in the background instead of closing it.

123
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,627
I know, this is an Android thing,

124
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,682
and to solve it,

125
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,798
I use Alt+F4 when I am using my bluetooth keyboard.

126
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:27,810
I could also use my bluetooth keyboard to open up the start menu apps too which is pretty neat.

127
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,557
When I wanted to swipe my finger from the top to the bottom

128
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:31,954
to see my Android settings,

129
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,791
it drags the window instead.

130
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:37,072
On my bluetooth mouse I just drag the it from the sides,

131
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:38,708
so no biggie most of the time.

132
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:41,373
Sometimes when I’m not using my bluetooth keyboard,

133
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:44,103
I use the on-screen keyboard to type something up

134
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:46,473
and the taskbar overlays the spacebar

135
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:50,028
so I lower it and then raise it when I’m done everytime.

136
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,856
Sentio Desktop has the option to make it the default launcher or home screen

137
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:56,558
which is pretty nice because when I clear all my apps,

138
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:59,453
Sentio goes away because that too is also an app,

139
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,550
so I want Sentio to always be there on boot even if I clear it out,

140
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:07,656
but setting Sentio as the default launcher doesn’t work unfortunately.

141
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:10,112
I like that Sentio Desktop works on my tablet,

142
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,878
it’s simple, it’s basic, get’s the job done,

143
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:15,668
but there's not much customizablity and features to it.

144
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:17,304
Moving on to Taskbar.

145
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:20,386
This is another alternative that I found to Samsung Dex

146
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:23,038
by a YouTuber named: Thommo’s Tech.

147
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:25,415
Taskbar is an app on the Google Play Store

148
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:27,942
that overlays a taskbar on your screen

149
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,959
in which you can open apps in windowed mode automatically,

150
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,757
allowing you to multitask efficiently on Android.

151
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:38,185
This apps looks more like an Android skin rather than a whole desktop interface,

152
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,657
but you can also enable a desktop mode in it's settings,

153
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:44,670
although I never tried this because I don't have an adapter

154
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,820
so comment down below.

155
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,395
The app is free to use,

156
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,626
it gets updated somewhat frequently,

157
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,111
and it's open source to!

158
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,901
You can see the source code on Github, link down below.

159
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:55,199
When you first start the app,

160
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,539
it takes you to the screen with all the settings.

161
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,402
These don't do anything unless we enable the taskbar

162
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:02,916
by pressing the button here on the top right,

163
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,591
accept some permissions,

164
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,674
and it's as simple as that.

165
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:10,720
Here is the taskbar.

166
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,335
You have your start menu,

167
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
widget button,

168
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:14,874
recent apps,

169
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,997
the system tray which just opens-

170
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:19,374
which just opens the quick panel layout,

171
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:22,265
and the collapse button, which collapses the taskbar.

172
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:25,898
It looks more like Chrome OS than Windows because of the big icons,

173
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:28,112
which is perfect for easily opening apps.

174
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:31,571
Now everytime we click on an app in the taskbar,

175
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,346
it opens it in fullscreen.

176
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:34,665
Not to worry though,

177
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:38,190
you can enable the windows by going into ‘freeform mode’

178
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:41,252
and ‘enable freeform windows support’.

179
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,359
Uncheck ‘launch games fullscreen’ if you haven't.

180
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,473
If games launch in fullscreen

181
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:51,186
you can just turn on ‘force activities to be resizeable’ in developer settings.

182
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:53,478
When turning on ‘freeform window support’,

183
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:56,538
the start menu glitches out which is pretty annoying,

184
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:59,112
Wait, oh hey-ay, it fixed itself woo-hoo!

185
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:03,775
but it eventually fixes itself somehow after I make changes to the settings

186
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,132
or restart my tablet.

187
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:08,283
Speaking of settings, this app is pretty customizable.

188
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,379
You can change your taskbars position,

189
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,449
the taskbars accent colors,

190
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,080
the amount of recent apps,

191
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:16,638
enable freeform mode,

192
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,095
enable desktop mode,

193
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,284
add some navigation buttons in advanced features,

194
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,240
and many more.

195
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:25,406
You can make the app look like how you want which I really appreciate.

196
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:28,559
I personally made my environment look like Chrome OS

197
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,149
and you can too, by:

198
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:33,461
going to general settings and check ‘launch on boot’;

199
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:36,725
recent apps → max number of 9 apps,

200
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,752
centered app icons,

201
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:41,326
show notification count in status area;

202
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:44,929
freeform mode → always save window size for apps,

203
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:47,367
default windows size as large;

204
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:52,530
advanced features → replace home screen and enable keyboard shortcuts.

205
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:54,529
Now go into your android settings,

206
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,770
and for me I go to:

207
00:08:55,795 --> 00:09:00,030
 apps → choose default apps → home app → taskbar.

208
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:01,865
Now that's what I'm talking about!

209
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:05,541
Everytime you turn on your tablet, it takes you to the taskbar desktop.

210
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,241
I'm not done yet of course,

211
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:10,642
right click the desktop to add icons to it and select an app.

212
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,245
You can move it by right clicking anywhere → move icon(s),

213
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,106
and move it based on the grid.

214
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:19,149
Right clicking an app on the start menu and taskbar

215
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:21,857
brings up options to open a new window in a:

216
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,046
standard,

217
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:25,647
large,

218
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:27,961
maximized,

219
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:30,808
left and right side of the screen

220
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,315
and phone size.

221
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:35,472
More actions depends on the app,

222
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,218
you can pin an app to recents,

223
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,455
view app info,

224
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,044
and uninstall an app all in taskbar!

225
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,008
There's a search bar in the start menu which you can turn off

226
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:48,326
and this 3 dot button just brings up standard Android stuff.

227
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:51,529
Every app you open up is based on what you did in the settings

228
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,808
but when you right click an app on the taskbar

229
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,717
→ new window → and then something other than large,

230
00:09:57,935 --> 00:10:00,798
the app will open in that window size everytime

231
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,607
because I checked this setting here.

232
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:04,934
"Oh yeah, one more thing."

233
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,242
POV: you posted cringe

234
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:08,367
You can hide and pin apps to start menu by going to:

235
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:11,022
general settings → configure apps in start menu

236
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,401
→ and check the apps you want to hide or pin.

237
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Check Google, Google TV.

238
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,738
And it should...

239
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,057
There it di- it disappeared.

240
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:19,139
Brave....

241
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:20,492
ChatGPT...

242
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:21,862
Pin My Files...

243
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,156
Pin Revanced Manager...

244
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:23,813
Pin...

245
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:24,996
My settings...

246
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:25,943
Oh, there we go.

247
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,921
And yeah, I'm pretty much done setting up my desktop.

248
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:33,314
Taskbar is a free and open source app that gets updated from time to time

249
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:35,474
and I really like that it's customizable,

250
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:37,758
but of course there are things that annoy me.

251
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:41,485
The app glitches at first when I turn on ‘freeform windows’.

252
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:44,674
Right clicking or holding an app or the desktop

253
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:48,167
brings up a context menu that you can't get rid of unless you

254
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:52,032
click on one of the options or press the recent apps buttons on your android.

255
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,456
And that will usually solve it.

256
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:56,085
You can’t move an app on the desktop as easily.

257
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:59,104
You can enable a keyboard shortcut to open up the start menu

258
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:02,363
but you need to set it as the assist app in settings

259
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,587
and you can't type up an app once opened.

260
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,047
Wait, they fixed it what?

261
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:08,093
Ok this script is really outdated.

262
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:10,242
Ok yeah what.

263
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,606
Ay I gues they fixed it, yippee!

264
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:13,833
As I stated before,

265
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:16,411
the system tray lacks a notification window,

266
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:18,652
battery percentage, and a calendar.

267
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,750
It just takes you to the quick panel layout.

268
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,958
That being said though.

269
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:26,669
I like that the recent apps actually update live everytime I open an app.

270
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,715
See that was instantaneous.

271
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,621
Swiping down to see the Android settings doesn't resize the windows which is pretty nice.

272
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:38,027
When using the onscreen keyboard to type,

273
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:41,034
taskbar automatically moves it up on top of my keyboard

274
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,727
and I can collapse the taskbar if it's in the way.

275
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:47,846
I really like Taskbar for its customization and the modern look.

276
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:51,407
Now this is not a comparison video by any means but if it were,

277
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,960
I would prefer Taskbar over Sentio Desktop

278
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:56,404
because I find it to be more useful for my tasks.

279
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:58,679
I was really thinking of throwing away my tablet

280
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,290
because I use my phone and my laptop more,

281
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:03,654
but I’d like to keep it because of portability,

282
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,777
it has a larger screen than my phone,

283
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:07,204
and the battery is fine.

284
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:10,887
Obviously it's not as powerful and you can't run .exes on it,

285
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,692
but it's fine for my use cases.

286
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:13,993
But yeah that’s pretty much it.

287
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,306
What app did you like more?

288
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,380
Sentio Desktop or Taskbar?

289
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:20,183
Until then, I'll see you guys next time, bye.
