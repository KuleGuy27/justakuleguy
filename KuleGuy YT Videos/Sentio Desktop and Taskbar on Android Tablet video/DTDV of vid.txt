* Using my Android Tablet as a computer via Sentio Desktop & Taskbar!

# HAPPY 4TH OF JULY ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. Sorry of this video's pace is a bit fast, I was rushing this out for the 4th of July holiday. Also sorry if my webcam isn't synced with my microphone audio, I have no idea what happened, maybe it's due to my OBS version but idk, I used Linux to record. I tried super hard to correct the issue, hopefully it's worth it.

I used to use my Android tablet a lot when I was in middle school, but now I don't due to me having a cellphone and my laptop. Recently, I've been thinking on how to give it a second life as I don't want to throw my gadget away in a landfill. Since I use my laptop for schoolwork a lot, I often thought of how I could use my Android tablet as a computer as well, kinda like a Microsoft Surface or a Google Chromebook, or a Samsung Tab S8 running Samsung Dex.

In this video, I have two free applications that allow you to multitask on your Android tablet and I recommend you check them out. The links are in order in occurence to the video.
