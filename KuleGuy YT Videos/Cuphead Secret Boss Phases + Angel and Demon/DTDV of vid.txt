# I've been uploading a lot of Cuphead videos, sorry. My next video is also gonna be a Cuphead video, hopefully that's the last one. I just love this game.

HOW TO GET THE SECRET BOSSES:
* The Root Pack - don't shoot the onion in the 2nd phase
* Djimmi The Great - stay in mini plane during the start of the 4th phase
* Sally Stageplay - jump on top of the baby angels in the 1st phase
* The Howling Aces - shoot the puppies until the all their smoke trails are gray but don't kill them; 2nd phase
* Angel and Demon - go to the climbers on the podium (1st place to 3rd place) and they will give you a hint for directions to click on the gravestones
