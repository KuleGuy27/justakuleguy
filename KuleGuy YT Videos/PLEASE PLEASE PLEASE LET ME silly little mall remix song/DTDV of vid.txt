* Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want - ROBLOX silly little mall remix

# I found this remix when I was playing ROBLOX - The Oldest View [silly little mall] and you can play it here: https://www.roblox.com/games/14997637453/The-Oldest-View-silly-little-mall

I heard this song in the background and I immediately knew that it was a remix to the song "Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want" by The Dream Academy or The Smiths.

I couldn't find a version of this remix online at the time so I waited for a while to screen record my pc when the remix came up and I edited the audio to discard the sound effects of thunder that was in the game. I later found a playlist that contained the song.

Here is the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0mQ3MGS8ydrflGW-it9loS8_01cbWp_7
