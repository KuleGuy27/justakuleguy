1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,208
I have a drawer with a lot of DVDs, CDs, and VHS tapes in my room.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,200
These are physical media that my dad bought years ago

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,580
just tucked away that we almost never use,

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,317
mostly because you can find reuploads online and that things can be watched via streaming nowadays.

5
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:20,750
Over this summer, I decided that I was gonna archive the ENTIRE collection and put it in my NAS,

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,317
partly because I was bored and also because physical media can rot and die away.

7
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:30,465
If you ever so slightly touch or scratch a DVD, or a VHS videotape,

8
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:31,767
it can ruin the media,

9
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:34,807
so it’s best to archive it in a digital format to preserve it.

10
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:40,000
This will take forever since I have hundreds of media, but it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make.

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:46,366
To get started, the first thing I do is to scan or photocopy whatever I can get using my parent's printer.

12
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:48,750
I connect the printer to my laptop

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,377
and I use the ‘Document Scanner’ app on Linux

14
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:54,018
or the ‘Windows Scan’ app on Windows.

15
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:59,685
If it has a cover like this, I scan each side individually and then put it together using GIMP.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,367
If it has paper, I lay it down on the machine and I scan it.

17
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:08,340
If it’s a disc or tape, I just put it face down on the scanner and scan it.

18
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:12,080
On Linux, I use the built in crop tool in ‘Document Scanner’

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,462
while in Windows, I use the default photo app to crop stuff.

20
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:20,809
You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to, I just personally do it for archiving purposes. [Also, it takes a long time]

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,458
So onto the actual thing, ripping DVDs to a video file format.

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,316
This is already pretty easy since DVDs are digital, it’s in the name.

23
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:37,592
What you need is a computer, a DVD drive, and a free and open source software called Handbrake (supported on all platforms).

24
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:43,150
The reason why I’m using Handbrake and not MakeMKV is because I personally find it a lot easier

25
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,267
and that Handbrake compresses the file while ripping it,

26
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:51,123
which is pretty handy since DVDs have a file size of around 5 GBs.

27
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:55,901
I haven’t tested this for Blu-ray discs because my laptop doesn’t support it

28
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:59,468
so I just used the Samsung blu-ray player in my living room

29
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,117
and a HDMI capture card to record it into OBS and I save it that way, anyway.

30
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,945
So once you installed Handbrake, put the DVD into your computer.

31
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,513
Ok so...

32
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,356
Ok it recognized it right here.

33
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:14,459
Let's cancel.

34
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:18,611
So on Handbrake, uh, click on open source, and then your DVD.

35
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:21,366
VIDEO_TS, then open it.

36
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,246
Now you have to wait for it to scan.

37
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,546
Ok so cool, so here's the preview.

38
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:29,857
You can change the preview by clicking on this, and then you can...

39
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:31,812
Change it...

40
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,054
Uh you can also change the title.

41
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,521
So if you don't have the right title, you can change it here.

42
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:41,877
Ok anyways, the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna click on, uh, the presets here.

43
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,413
Then general, and then...

44
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,550
Fast 480p30

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,772
We don't have to change dimensions or filters, but we do have to change video.

46
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:53,537
So in video, um, change the framerate to same as source.

47
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:55,467
And then to constant framerate.

48
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:56,973
Then to audio.

49
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:59,799
Uh click on add all to add all the audios.

50
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,599
Uh you can add them all individually.

51
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:05,000
Then subtitles, um, add all if you want.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,129
Uh you can press reload to, uh, reset it.

53
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:10,857
Anyways, I'm gonna save the new preset that I just made, so...

54
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:15,204
I'm gonna name this preset '_tutorial'.

55
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:16,192
Ok

56
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:17,330
Oh (chuckle)

57
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,188
Wait let's add them again.

58
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:20,721
Ok ok

59
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,448
So audio and subtitles, alright cool cool cool.

60
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,664
Chapters...

61
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:25,917
Tags...

62
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:26,514
Alright.

63
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,767
Now all we have to do is to export it so

64
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:33,388
So, it's gonna export to uh, videos, the default folder.

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,354
Right here.

66
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:36,439
But anyways, let's change it to um...

67
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:41,402
Big Hero 6 tutorial rip.

68
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,374
Ok now let's start.

69
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,578
And it should be ripping or encoding.

70
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:50,316
So it's gonna take like, ok like, 34 minutes I guess.

71
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,685
I'll catch you up when it's back.

72
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,983
Alright so when it's done, it should say "encode done" right here at the bottom.

73
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:58,750
So...

74
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,576
It saves to your video folder right here.

75
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,684
Alright here it is right here.

76
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,834
It's 1.2GB so...

77
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,663
That's way less, anyways let's open it.

78
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:09,226
And...

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,528
As you can see.

80
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:13,734
Yeah it works right there.

81
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:16,903
So at the top here let's tinker with the menu, so chapter.

82
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,689
So let's go to chapter 4.

83
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,163
There we go, let's go to chapter 7 right here.

84
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,095
There we go nice

85
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:24,077
On 1

86
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,085
All the way to beginning.

87
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:27,997
So now the audio track.

88
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:29,470
Um, let's do uh...

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,447
French, let's see.

90
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:37,717
[Speaking French]

91
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,210
Then Spanish.

92
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:47,550
[Speaking Spanish]

93
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:48,739
Uh, subtitles.

94
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:55,184
[Speaking English]

95
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,747
Ok there- it was delayed.

96
00:04:56,747 --> 00:05:06,581
[Speaking English]

97
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,835
So nice, everything works, um...

98
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,513
Let's go to codec, so...

99
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,039
Oh so it's 360p alright (x2).

100
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:13,985
Close enough

101
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,742
 24fps alright

102
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,317
Ok so cool, we have everything.

103
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,562
We have the chapters.

104
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:20,904
We have audio, the audio tracks.

105
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,267
The subtitles.

106
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,296
Yeah we pretty much have everything.

107
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:28,108
But yeah, that's how you rip your DVDs to your computer.

108
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,812
Next is ripping CDs to an audio file format.

109
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:35,439
Saying that makes me sound like a nerd bruh.

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,956
Again, you need a computer, a CD drive, Asunder CD Ripper for Linux and Windows Media Player for Windows.

111
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:44,034
Let’s get into it.

112
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:48,473
So once that we have Asunder CD Ripper installed on your computer.

113
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,473
Insert the CD into your computer.

114
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,005
So it detected it, that's pretty nice.

115
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:53,595
And...

116
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:55,695
Make sure it's all the correct metadata, so nice...

117
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:56,975
This is Mozart, and then...

118
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:57,945
Bach.

119
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,346
Beethoven.

120
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,175
Chopin.

121
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,149
Yeah ok, this is.

122
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:02,394
This is correct, ok.

123
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,291
So I don't really have to do anything here, it's already pretty good, but um...

124
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,476
I'm gonna go to uh, preferences here.

125
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:08,800
In general, uh...

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,569
Uncheck 'create M3U playlist'.

127
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,062
So uncheck it because it makes an extra file that you don't really need.

128
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:17,167
It's just a playlist.

129
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:17,928
Um...

130
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,845
Filenames, you don't really need anything.

131
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:21,498
Encode, now...

132
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,325
On default, it's OGG.

133
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,937
But, I'm just gonna click on MP3.

134
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:29,395
If there's an error on MP3, just um, go into your terminal.

135
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:33,626
'Sudo apt install lame', with an L.

136
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,127
So install that.

137
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:40,945
There we go, it should work.

138
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,217
Now change it to.

139
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,330
190, like, kbps (kilobits per second).

140
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:47,436
So yeah there we go.

141
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,777
Um yeah, that's it, just...

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,513
Uncheck this, and then check this.

143
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:56,791
Oh yeah, you can also change the destination folder, but I'm just gonna leave it on music.

144
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,438
But yeah...

145
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,612
Now rip it.

146
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:06,165
Okay so once it's done, it should say all files are created successfully.

147
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:07,110
Now close that.

148
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,184
So it should appear in your music folder.

149
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:11,639
So Various - 21 Greatest Classics.

150
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,893
Let's click on it, so...

151
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,750
Here is all the 21 songs.

152
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,975
Let's click on Chopin I guess.

153
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:24,799
[Beautiful Chopin music]

154
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:26,389
Ok so nice.

155
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,047
So it has the meta data, it's...

156
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:30,076
Ok so there's the title, there's the artist

157
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,630
I don't know what's 'Various', but...

158
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,397
it has the album, the year, the track.

159
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,187
Yeah.

160
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:41,098
[Music to my ears 🎵]

161
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:41,965
Yeah nice.

162
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,353
[Music]

163
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:48,522
Yeah (x3) nice.

164
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:53,802
So that's how you rip, um, your CDs files onto your computer, your Linux machine.

165
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,984
And yeah there you go, it's pretty easy.

166
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,925
But let's check on Windows.

167
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:02,299
Ok so now that I have my Windows Media Player on and my, uh, CD inserted.

168
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:03,436
It has all the correct-  (metadata here, so...)
The video file was corrupted :(
It works in the video editor but not in the video player or render, sorry.

169
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:04,439
Mozart.

170
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:05,186
Bach.

171
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:06,645
Bee- Beethoven.

172
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,863
Uh I can't pronounce it.

173
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:08,667
Chopin.

174
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:09,503
Alright nice.

175
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,531
So now it's time to rip it so anyways.

176
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:16,070
So rip settings, to change stuff to make your life easier while ripping it, so um...

177
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,269
Format... I'll format it to MP3

178
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:22,107
Then the audio quality to, uh, 192 kbps (kilobits per second).

179
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:24,178
Now you can go to more options.

180
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:26,527
So here, you can change the location of it.

181
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:27,315
Uh...

182
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,357
Oh this is the same settings, alright.

183
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:31,318
So you don't really need to change anything here.

184
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,122
It's all good.

185
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:33,268
So uh yeah.

186
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:36,591
Now time to rip it, so let's press on 'Rip CD'.

187
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,183
And yeah there you go, it's ripping.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,078
Ok so, it's all done.

189
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:43,890
It should be saying 'Ripped to library'.

190
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,401
So if I go open my music folder.

191
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,786
I can see it has, again, the folder.

192
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:50,993
And then, ugh, the folder inside it

193
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:52,509
Okay there we go.

194
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:57,727
Okay so I closed the media player, let's click on like, open with VLC I guess, Mozart.

195
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,983
Ok so yeah, that's pretty nice.

196
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:05,937
Chopin.

197
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:11,781
Ok nice, just how, uh, I remember it.

198
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:12,853
Mozart again.

199
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:18,792
Ok.

200
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:24,337
So yeah, that's how you rip, uh, your CD files to your computer using Windows Media Player on Windows.

201
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:28,317
Finally, converting VHS tapes to a digital format.

202
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,235
Thanks to ‘The Oldskool PC’ on YouTube, I learned that you need a capture card to do this.

203
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,145
I got mine for 40 bucks on Amazon which is quite expensive,

204
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:41,994
but I got this one because I wanted to capture the VHS to 60FPS video.

205
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,181
So you pretty much need

206
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:47,118
a computer, a VHS capture card, a VCR player,

207
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:51,239
and OBS studio running on Windows because it didn’t work for me on Linux,

208
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,115
I wish it did.

209
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:56,417
You know how a VCR player connects to a TV via a RCA connector,

210
00:09:56,417 --> 00:10:00,370
and when you put in your VHS tape, it plays the tape onto your TV?

211
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,092
Well, what if you can connect the VCR player to your computer!

212
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,258
Using the adapter I just talked about,

213
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:08,927
connect the RCA cable to the capture card,

214
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:12,151
and plug in the USB side to your Windows machine.

215
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:15,550
Now go to the link or website I put in the description

216
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,514
and download the driver for the capture card from there.

217
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,888
Now that we have things set up,

218
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:24,550
we can use OBS Studio to record the VHS tape onto the computer.

219
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,315
This will take a long time since we’re not ripping but recording,

220
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:32,792
and it will take longer if your VHS tape is like 6 hours or something.

221
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:36,379
Ok so I'm on my Windows 10 main computer right here.

222
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,450
So I'm assuming you guys have everything set up .

223
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,515
You guys have your capture card connected to your computer.

224
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,145
And you have the driver downloaded.

225
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:46,255
Um you can use any capture card that you guys, uh, want.

226
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm not sure if this would apply to everybody because not everybody has 40$ to spend, but anyways.

227
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:56,033
So we have the hardware, so now let's open up the OBS Studio software.

228
00:10:57,926 --> 00:11:03,271
OBS studio is like the default industry standard application for recording and streaming stuff.

229
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,897
So I'm pretty sure you guys have heard of this software before.

230
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,541
You guys already know how it works.

231
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,000
Anyways, enough yapping.

232
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:11,800
Following 'The Oldskool PC's tutorial.

233
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,917
What he did was he added a new profile.

234
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,556
So, profile -> new.

235
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:18,510
VHS Capture

236
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:23,750
Uh, optimize for recording, next (x2), apply,

237
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,465
Then he added a new scene.

238
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:26,924
So, scene collection -> new.

239
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
VHS Capture

240
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,370
Ok

241
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:33,550
This makes it so that you can switch between your, uh, stuff.

242
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,075
Yeah it's pretty handy, wait.

243
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,046
Yeah there we go.

244
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,776
So now let's add a new dock.

245
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:41,160
So, docks -> stats.

246
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:43,886
I already set it up right here, but yeah.

247
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:47,332
So this is that you can view your stats, I guess yeah.

248
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,631
Anyways let's go down here to the settings.

249
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,442
This is the real kicker here, um...

250
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,730
So go to output.

251
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,471
Now change this output mode to advanced.

252
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,873
And then recording.

253
00:11:58,044 --> 00:12:02,136
Now we're going to change the recording format to .mp4.

254
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,963
And then the video encoder to x264.

255
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:08,603
The reason why is so that I can go here to the bottom.

256
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,742
Change the rate control to CRF.

257
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:14,070
Then change it to, um, 18.

258
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:17,920
 This is so that the file size doesn't become big I guess.

259
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,507
Now go over here to audio.

260
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:23,401
And then set the default audio to the capture card device.

261
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,000
Now go to a video.

262
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:27,071
Then change the resolution, so...

263
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:33,561
VHS tapes or video are typically in the 4:3 aspect ratio, so let's change it, so...

264
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:37,411
1440 by 1080 if you want 1080P.

265
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,055
Then add if for both fields.

266
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:43,261
Or 960 by 720 for 720P.

267
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,000
Add if for both fields there we go.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,822
Now change the FPS to 59.94.

269
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,722
And we should be all good to go.

270
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,550
Ok

271
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,550
So now let's add in our video, so...

272
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:54,938
At the sources right here,

273
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:58,774
let's click the plus sign, then add our video capture device.

274
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,635
Ok

275
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,672
Now add in our device.

276
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:02,774
And yeah, there we go.

277
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,135
To make the size larger, you can press Ctrl+F for fullscreen.

278
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:09,140
So yeah, there we go, it's fullscreened.

279
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,752
Ok so I rewinded the tape, but it doesn't really matter.

280
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:14,037
Um the video looks a bit bright.

281
00:13:14,037 --> 00:13:15,476
I'm (x2) not sure why.

282
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:18,599
I think it's just something with the capture card I have, but anyways.

283
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,549
If (x2) it's so bright, you can just change it in the settings, so...

284
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,835
Click your capture card and go to the properties, then you can configure the video.

285
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,317
Uh...

286
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:29,317
Yeah ok, I can change the brightness here.

287
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:30,507
Yeah, woah.

288
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,790
Woah, alright (x2).

289
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,407
I'm not sure which capture card you guys have, but you can configure it if necessary.

290
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:40,139
Ok anyways it looks about right, so...

291
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:44,000
Anyways, now that you have configured your video you can start recording, but...

292
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,488
If your capture card supports it,

293
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:48,925
you can turn this video from 30 fps to 60 FPS,

294
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,864
by right clicking on the video capture device.

295
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,757
Deinterlacing, and then Yadif 2x, this is like, the best option.

296
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,234
Oh yeah, there we go, 60 FPS.

297
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,511
Then right click again, scale filtering and then Lanczos, I guess.

298
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:06,671
Better quality.

299
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:10,983
So now that I have everything set up, I can start recording it, so...

300
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,726
Let's start yeah, there we go...

301
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:16,238
Ok so, let's stop now.

302
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,750
OBS saves your videos to the video, uh, folder, so...

303
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:22,273
Here's my video, let's check to see if it works.

304
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:27,285
...cười, cho kiếp người tình thương đắm đuối 🎵.
...smile, give a lifetime of passionate love 🎵. (google translate)

305
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:31,135
Ánh xuân đem vui với đời. 🎵 
Spring light brings joy to life.  🎵 (google translate)

306
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,600
The sound works, so yeah, it's a success!

307
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,657
Now sometimes you can see that it drops frames.

308
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:37,073
Like, some parts.

309
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:40,254
But when going back to recording it's pretty smooth, I don't know why.

310
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,624
Lo- ư ư look, it dropped frames, for some reason.

311
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,000
Or sometimes if the video doesn't look good,

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,850
you can just, um, change the cha-.

313
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,245
I just change the channel.

314
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,819
Press the button on my VCR player

315
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,957
I'm not sure which VCR player you guys have, but yeah...

316
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:59,484
...đã đến rồi, gieo rắc ngàn hồn hoa xuống đời. 🎵
...has arrived, spreading thousands of flower souls into the world.  🎵 (gg translate)

317
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:04,857
Vui trong bình minh, muôn loài chim hót vang mọi nơi. 🎵
Happy in the dawn, all kinds of birds sing everywhere.  🎵 (gg translate)

318
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:09,376
But yeah, that’s how I archive/preserve/rip my physical media.

319
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:12,153
This is gonna take me quite a while to archive everything

320
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,153
since I have hundreds of the stuff,

321
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:15,749
but it’s worth it to be honest.

322
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:16,980
But with that being said,

323
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,234
my name is Luke,

324
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,892
save your physical media,

325
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:22,149
and I’ll see you guys next time, bye.
