* How I Grind Exp in ROBLOX - War of the Worlds

# My favorite ROBLOX gun game at the moment. The game is based on a science fiction book about an alien invasion on Earth and there's a popular movie about it in 2005 starring Tom Cruise if you wanna watch.

The game is fine but the minigun and the uberpod costs a lot of exp so I went out of my way and I found that this is the best way to grind for exp in the game.
