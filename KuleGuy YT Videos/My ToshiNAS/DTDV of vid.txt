* Turning my 2009 Laptop into an easy home NAS! (Ubuntu Server + CasaOS)

# I've been thinking of storage ever since I got a notification on an iPhone 4 saying I need to buy more storage on iCloud. Thanks to the internet, I learned something called a NAS (Network Attached Storage), it's like Google Drive or some other cloud service but YOU get control of your data and not some company. In this video, I made my own NAS instead of buying a prebuilt one on Amazon because of money. Here's my journey to my first home nas and obviously, I'm not an expert, so leave your comments down below if I mess up something.
