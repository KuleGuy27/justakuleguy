00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,642
As someone who's been making YouTube videos and filming things for fun,

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:06,330
I've been thinking of a storage solution.

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,174
When I was first making YouTube videos,

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:13,042
I would upload my videos, and then delete the original video files to save hard drive space.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,684
So my videos are saved on the internet unless I delete them.

6
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:21,271
It's kinda like cloud storage but for free an anybody can view them.

7
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:22,990
Speaking of cloud storage,

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,146
why didn’t I just use Google Drive,

9
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:25,943
why didn’t I just use Google Drive, Dropbox,

10
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:26,830
why didn’t I just use Google Drive, Dropbox, Mega, 

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,442
why didn’t I just use Google Drive, Dropbox, Mega, Mediafire and etc?

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:35,698
I could've used these but they are paid services and the free amount of storage isn't enough for what I'm doing. 

13
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:42,041
In November 2022, my aunt gave me her 1TB external hard drive, and that was a game changer.

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:47,779
I used it to store old family photos, some music, and my YouTube videos that I keep on making.

15
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:53,584
An external hard drive is an internal hard drive just with a case around it

16
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:56,334
and it comes with this usb connector,

17
00:00:56,334 --> 00:01:02,603
that way I can carry this with me anywhere I want and I can access the data on it using the usb connector

18
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:05,541
but that’s not ideal and it’s usually a hassle.

19
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:06,896
So what can I do now?

20
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,897
Thanks to the internet, I learned about something called a NAS 

21
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:12,882
which stands for “Network Attached Storage.”

22
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:21,640
A NAS is a metal box, basically a computer, which has stuff like cpu, ram, and hard drives bays all in one box.

23
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:29,084
You can connect it to your router via ethernet and send your data to a network which you can access wherever you want.

24
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,397
It’s what people call a “personal cloud” because:

25
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:37,776
you can scale or it replace a drive if it dies and YOU have control over your data,

26
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:41,074
so no company to spy on your important files.

27
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:46,000
Just like computers, there are tons of prebuilt NAS boxes floating on Amazon,

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,845
but because I don't have the money and because I want to,

29
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:54,125
I'm building my own NAS using what I already have, a laptop and some hard drives.

30
00:01:54,453 --> 00:02:02,250
For this video, I am using my 2009 Toshiba Satellite L455-S5980 Laptop,

31
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,140
what a mouthful.

32
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:08,456
It has an Intel Celeron T300 1.8ghz processor,

33
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:10,519
4gb of ram (upgraded),

34
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,834
and a 512gb 2.5inch SSD (upgraded).

35
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:17,663
Which is quite slow, but it’s all I have.

36
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:23,166
So I have the laptop as a NAS, now is a good time to discuss what hard drives I am using.

37
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:26,355
I am using 3 Seagate hard drives.

38
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:30,560
I have a 2TB external drive that costs $60,

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,718
a 4TB external drive that costs $89

40
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:39,596
and a 6TB Expansion drive that costs $120.

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,504
In total, it costs $269 USD for the hard drives.

42
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:48,680
This is not really a budget build, but it’s whatever, it’s what I have already.

43
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:51,084
That’s cool, but where am I gonna put my NAS at?

44
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:52,959
My room of course.

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,802
This area used to have a lot of Legos on it, but I had to clean it up to be able to put the NAS here which took quite a while.

46
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:05,455
So I have the computer, the hard drives, and the ethernet cable all connected.

47
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:07,042
Speaking of the ethernet cable,

48
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:12,042
many moons ago, my dad bought a long 75ft cat8 ethernet cable

49
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,933
which connects to an ethernet switch in my parents room,

50
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,669
then it goes into a hole in the wall and up into the attic.

51
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:27,042
The cable comes down from this hole that was used for a TV cable in my closet, to under my desk and then to the computer here.

52
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,808
So I have the stuff setup, now it’s time to make it work.

53
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:35,202
The operating system I’m gonna be using for this video is Ubuntu Server and CasaOS.

54
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:38,523
The reason why is because I’m following a Tech Hut video.

55
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,889
Yeah...

56
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:46,127
I have tried TrueNAS and OMV before, but I’m trying this out because it seems easier.

57
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:53,102
First things first, I went to the Ubuntu server website and downloaded the iso image just like any other operating system.

58
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:56,777
After it’s done downloading, I burn it to a USB stick.

59
00:03:56,777 --> 00:04:00,669
And after that, I put it in to the computer and I install the OS.

60
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:05,687
The process was really simple and I didn’t really have to follow a tutorial for this one.

61
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:12,738
Also, make sure to uncheck the LVM group because it splits your drive into multiple partitions.

62
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:22,140
After it’s done installing on the old laptop, I went to my main computer to ssh into it.

63
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:29,375
You can do that by typing: ssh, space, your username, the @ symbol, and the ip address of your server.

64
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:37,928
Once that’s done, do a simple sudo apt update, and then install Casa OS by copying and pasting in the curl command.

65
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,536
Now just sit and relax, it’s doing all the work for you.

66
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:50,079
After CasaOS is done installing, copy the link that it gave you, aka your ip address, and paste it in to your web browser.

67
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,766
You can just type it in if you want.

68
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:56,211
The CasaOS login screen should pop-up, type in your credentials and viola!

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,601
This is CasaOS.

70
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:02,334
The first thing I did was to format all the drives just it case and after it’s done,

71
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,929
I had to refresh the page because it didn’t show for some reason.

72
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:15,334
Anyways, I went to the default files app, pressed on one of my drives, then went back to the devmon folder, and then right click → share my drives.

73
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,750
I couldn’t figure out how to rename the drives in CasaOS

74
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:23,084
but at least I can just mount and rename it in my file manager,

75
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,461
and there also is a way to merge all your hard drives in one piece,

76
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:31,213
but I had some issues with that in the past, so I didn’t bother.

77
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:36,858
When I typed the ip address into my file manager, Dolphin, the shared drives appeared.

78
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,469
And for the moment you’ve all been waiting for, speed.

79
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:47,567
When copying files from my backup hard drive to the NAS, the speed is pretty slow at around 10mb/s.

80
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:55,651
This is not really surprising as I am using low end hardware, so of course, it took many hours for me to copy everything into the NAS.

81
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,042
Anyways, since it’s a NAS and it’s in my local network,

82
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:07,829
I could connect it to my main desktop as I’ve already shown you, my HP laptop that I use mainly for school, and my Android phone,

83
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:11,888
although I had to use another app for this because the default one sucks.

84
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:18,079
Cool, but there’s one more thing that I need to do, and that is to access it from anywhere in the world.

85
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,019
Well, I don’t travel much, so from my school.

86
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:29,072
This was the most complicated step because I didn’t really know what to do, so I followed a YouTube tutorial by BigBearTechWorld.

87
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:35,467
It was pretty complicated at first, I lost a couple of braincells, but after doing it, I understand it now.

88
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:41,329
So basically what I did was I installed Tailscale on the NAS using the curl command,

89
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:47,552
the Tailscale connects to my Google account as well and it gave me an entirely different ip address.

90
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:51,851
I used the curl command to install Tailscale on my HP laptop

91
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:55,446
and I used the Android app to connect it on my phone as well.

92
00:06:55,446 --> 00:07:02,795
Since the devices are in one place, I can use the different ip address for the NAS and I can connect it anywhere I go.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,281
But yeah, I’m done!

94
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:11,129
I can store footage onto it until it runs out or one drive dies and I can also access it from anywhere in the world.

95
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:18,915
It’s amazing to see how a laptop that could’ve been thrown away can be used for a NAS, essentially putting it to some use.

96
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,886
For now though, this is gonna be temporary.

97
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:27,187
I don’t really like the speeds of it, and also the hard drives are all gonna die in the future anyways.

98
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:29,516
Some things just don’t last forever.

99
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,110
But yeah, this is my server.

100
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,709
My name is Luke, and I am out.
