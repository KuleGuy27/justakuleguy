* ROBLOX War of the Worlds - Using the helicopter

# I haven't seen many videos on this vehicle, only one. Just wanted to show you guys how the helicopter operates. The helicopter costs 50,000 exp and maybe that's why there's not enough videos on it. The helicopter explodes when you hit something hard or when a tripod uses their heatrays on you. The cameras don't match each other which is pretty realistic.

The controls are simple
Q - Descend
E - Ascend
V - Switch Cameras
F - Switch Weapons
Mouse - Rotate Camera
WASD to move

You use your mouse and tilt your helicopter down to the ground to move it forward quickly and you tilt it up into the sky to move it backwards quickly as well.
