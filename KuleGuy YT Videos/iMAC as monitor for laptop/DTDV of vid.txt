* How to use an iMAC as a 2nd monitor for Windows/Any Laptop.

# Filmed on the 6th of November 2023.

I filmed this in school because I don't have any Apple computers at home. Sorry if the mic quality is bad, the earphone I used was $1 and I put it inside my mask. I went to the Walmart Supercenter (in real life) to spend $20 USD for the small capture card. It's worth it because I can use it for school, Canon camera, and mirroring HDMI output.

I feel like I'm the only one in my school who actually does this.
