* Replaying my favorite ROBLOX Bloody Mary game for Halloween!

#
When I was younger, I remember playing a ROBLOX Bloody Mary game which I still remember to this day. It was a 2009 game made my HauntedUSA and it was really popular for it's time, but unfortunately, the original is now privated and I heard it was broken due to old scripts :( In this video, I'll go over the recreations or mock ups of what the game used to be like. Kinda getting nostalgic just playing this.
