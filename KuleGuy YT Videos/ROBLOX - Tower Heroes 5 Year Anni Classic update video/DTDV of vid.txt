* Playing the ROBLOX Tower Heroes 5 Year Anniversary Update!

# The team or person behind ROBLOX Tower Heroes released an update where they brought back the classic map with the classic music, so nostalgic. In this video, I tried 2 new maps that I've never played before: Relentless Reflections and The Library. I haven't played the game in a while because I lost interest from time to time and that I need an alt account to beat hard maps. Maybe I'll make more videos on this game. Idk, there are too many games...
