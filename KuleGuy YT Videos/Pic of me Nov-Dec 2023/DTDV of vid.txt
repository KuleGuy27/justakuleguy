* A picture of me from November-December 2023

# 61 Pictures of from the 1st of November to the 31st of December 2023.

I got inspired from Hugo Cornellier, taking a webcam selfie picture of himself everyday. I made this just for fun and I don't want to commit to taking a photo of myself for years like what Hugo did.
Also sorry about the ending, I switched computers haha.
