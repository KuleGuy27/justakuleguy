* Using Sponsorblock to cut this video!

# 
Happy Halloween! You probably don't know this but I use an extension called "Sponsorblock" and all it does is automatically skip sponsor segments in YouTube videos. It's 100% community driven and tons of users contribute to it by adding their own segments to videos so people can skip sponsors. Besides that, you can use Sponsorblock to block: intros, outros, shoutouts, filler, and etc... For this video, U purposely talked slow and pause to add silence and I will use the filler feature to cut out the dead space in it.

On your PC or mobile, you should set the 'filler' to auto skip so it feels like I edited this video. Cheers :)
