* This game changed my life (ROBLOX Tower Heroes)

# Play it here: https://www.roblox.com/games/4646477729/Tower-Heroes-CRAFTING-UPDATE

Tower Heroes is a cartoonish tower defence game where you prevent enemies from getting to the other side by placing down your towers (or heroes idk). It's one of my favorite ROBLOX games that I've played it since 2020. I've taken a break from playing it since it got boring to me for a while, it took a lot of time, and some maps are not easy to solo. In this video, I'll just play some of the new maps to see what it's like and what aspects of the game are changed.
Also sorry for the video quality, I recorded this video using my $20 Walmart HDMI capture card and it can only record 60fps at 720p, I got falsely advertised :(
