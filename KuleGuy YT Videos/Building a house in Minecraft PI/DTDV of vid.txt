* Building a simple house in Minecraft Pi Reborn edition

# My first gaming video on this channel :)

I'm a bit rushy today. I couldn't get Tlauncher to work so I used the Minecraft Pi Reborn Edition, which I downloaded here: https://gitea.thebrokenrail.com/minecraft-pi-reborn/minecraft-pi-reborn/releases. 

I just wanted to get a video just in time because today is my sister's birthday and building this Minecraft house takes you about 30-ish minutes to build.
