1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,610
Wassup nerds, it's me, Luke Smith.

2
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:05,471
So there are 2 types of computer users out there,

3
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:09,196
people who use MacOS and people who use Windows OS.

4
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:12,415
Now currently, I use neither, because I am using Linux.

5
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:15,673
"Oh my gosh, the sun here is so bright, I can't see anything."

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,101
Now you might be wondering, what's Linux, I've never heard of it?

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,355
Well that's because Linux has less than 4% marketshare while Windows and MacOS takes the leaderboard.

8
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:31,490
Now the reason why people use MacOS and Windows is because it's sold with the computer and it's easy to use.

9
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:36,093
When you go to Walmart, or Costco, or Best Buy and you buy a prebuilt laptop,

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,472
it most likely has Windows or MacOS pre-installed on it,

11
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,721
so these 2 OSes are people defaults.

12
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:46,212
Also, ease of use.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,867
Most people in the world aren't tech savvy, 

14
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:54,421
they just want to browse the web, send emails, print documents, and etc…

15
00:00:54,808 --> 00:01:01,867
Windows and MacOS do a very good job at hiding the systems guts and presenting everything by a gui,

16
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:08,595
because of that, people who've been through lobatamies can use the 2 OSes because the ux is just so straightforward.

17
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:11,248
Now to answer the question, why do I use Linux?

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Most people use Windows and MacOS,

19
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:17,181
why do I use an os that not that many people pay attention to?

20
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:19,449
Well, it's because I want to,

21
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:21,642
it seems like a very fun hobby,

22
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:25,000
and it's also because I don't like the 2 other OSes.

23
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:30,496
Despite being called “Windows”, you can't even look inside the source code, it's proprietary. 

24
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:33,240
The OS is slow because of bloat, 

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,746
a Microsoft Account is required to install it,

26
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,314
telemetry,

27
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:38,943
ads in the start menu,

28
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:41,389
removed features, and etc…

29
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,106
On MacOS,

30
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:46,831
and I've only used this at school because I don't have a MacBook.

31
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:49,296
It's easy to use and simplistic,

32
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:53,007
but because they focus so much on simplicity,

33
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:56,420
there are basic features like Window snapping not present,

34
00:01:56,985 --> 00:02:00,249
and you need to find a 3rd party alternative to get things going.

35
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:04,926
Both of them are paid, close source, and have little to no customization.

36
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,494
Those are my reasons on why I’m on Linux.

37
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:12,826
I often hear that people who use Windows or MacOS say that Linux is HARD,

38
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:17,443
and that is true at times because some things don’t work out of the box,

39
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:21,035
but it’s also because your brain doesn’t work out of the box.

40
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,288
A lack of understanding pretty much.

41
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:27,444
From my understanding, Linux is a kernel, aka, the systems guts.

42
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,612
It was made in 1991 by Linus Torvalds

43
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:36,226
and it was closed source at first but then open source and because of that,

44
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:39,341
there are Linux Distros aka Distrobutions,

45
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:42,738
pretty much operating systems based on the Linux kernel.

46
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,301
There are distrobutions like:

47
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:52,340
Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop_OS, Zorin OS, Fedora, Manjaro, and many more,

48
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:56,547
like 600 Linux distros,

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,692
because Linux is free as in price and in freedom,

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,863
because you can mess around with the source code.

51
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:05,800
So I don’t use an operating system called “Linux”

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,886
like what you call MacOS and WindowsOS.

53
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:14,783
I use a distro of it, but people say Linux because it’s the foundation.

54
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,705
So there are 600 distros out there,

55
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:18,545
nice,

56
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:19,905
that’s a lot of options,

57
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:21,652
but what distro do I use?

58
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,065
On my All-in-one desktop, I use Kubuntu

59
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,285
and on my laptop, I use Linux Mint.

60
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,625
These are distrobutions based off of Ubuntu

61
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:36,077
and because of that, these are the easy to use Linux Distros that I use.

62
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:41,721
My experience on Linux so far is easy because I use Kubuntu and Mint.

63
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:44,316
Linux distros come in all shapes and sizes,

64
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,613
some are easy, some are hard.

65
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:51,065
The hard Linux distros are Arch and Gentoo,

66
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:56,619
these are DIY distros where you build or compile your own distro.

67
00:03:56,976 --> 00:04:00,969
These are popular distros because people just wanna flex,

68
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,629
but not everyone uses them.

69
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:05,492
To me, when you’re saying “Linux is difficult”,

70
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,741
I think you’re comparing a Arch to Windows or something.

71
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:11,217
So what are the upsides to using Linux?

72
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,056
There are 3 things that come to my mind.

73
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,331
Security, Lightweightness, and Customization.

74
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:22,557
There are times when I have gotten a virus on my Windows laptop,

75
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:26,133
and since I use Windows, they track my user activity.

76
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:30,512
From what I read, Macs don't track you and have less viruses,

77
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,657
but I'm not gonna spend 2 grand on a laptop am I?

78
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:38,602
Windows has more viruses because it's popular and the source code is hidden,

79
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:41,677
therefore it's slower to fix problems.

80
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:44,272
On Linux, it's not that popular,

81
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,659
but since the source code is open,

82
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:54,014
you can look for bugs and issues and fix them yourself instead of waiting for Windows to fix stuff for you…

83
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,372
So for Windows users who worry about privacy, switching to Linux might just be a no-brainer.

84
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,724
"Oh my gosh, there's a shadow here"

85
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:09,205
The 2nd reason is that Linux is more lightweight than Windows and MacOS.

86
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:11,532
If you're running low spec hardware,

87
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:16,566
Linux can breathe new life into your computer because of low spec requirements.

88
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:22,880
Windows eats up a lot of ram and you can't even install MacOS on any laptop.

89
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:28,127
For something that's free and open source,

90
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,062
it's pretty awesome to see the affects it can do on your computer.

91
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:36,278
Goes to show how bloated proprietary software can be.

92
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,918
The third reason is customization.

93
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:41,990
On Macs, you can't customize or install themes,

94
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:45,968
it's locked down and I guess it's so that you don't break anything.

95
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:49,263
Windows is much more customizable than MacOS,

96
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,891
but on Windows 11, 

97
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,724
you can't even move your taskbar to the left or right,

98
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:54,922
what the heck?

99
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,697
Ok, Editors note here,

100
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:58,846
I forgot to say something about Linux.

101
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,947
So I am using the KDE Plasma Desktop Environment,

102
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:04,894
which is a style of how your desktop looks.

103
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:05,950
In my settings,

104
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,653
I can easily change the:

105
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:10,307
I can easily change the: colors,

106
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:12,054
I can easily change the: colors, window decorations,

107
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:14,054
I can easily change the: colors, window decorations, icons,

108
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:16,638
it’s so easy.

109
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:19,560
And look, I can move my taskbar around!

110
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:23,033
So the downsides to Linux, what are they?

111
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:26,432
To me, it's compatiblility and ease of use.

112
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,451
Some people have this thinking that, 

113
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:32,637
“anything can work on any computer, it doesn't matter the operating system”.

114
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:36,422
But the truth is, computers are not the same.

115
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:40,000
Programs that work on Mac will work on Mac, 

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,957
and programs that work on Windows will work on Windows.

117
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,894
Because Windows and Mac are so popular,

118
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:51,735
developers develop the programs and apps on those platforms

119
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:57,126
and Linux gets left out because the Linux userbase is so small,

120
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,620
there's no incentive. 

121
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:02,420
On Windows, that's where all the games are being developed, 

122
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,688
all the graphics drivers work. 

123
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,252
No joke, 

124
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:09,279
when I installed DaVinci Resolve on Fedora,

125
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,064
I had to use the terminal to install dependencies to get it working.

126
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:16,001
But on Windows, it just works right out of the box.

127
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,480
Why?!

128
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:21,076
Which gets me into my 2nd downside, ease of use.

129
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:25,932
Sometimes when something goes wrong, you have to open up a terminal to fix things.

130
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:28,809
For advanced users, this isn't an issue, 

131
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:32,162
but for the average Joe out there, this can be daunting.

132
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:39,844
Personally for me though,

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,570
I can deal with this because it is convenient to type in a command than to open up settings,

134
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,983
but it does stress me out a lot at times.

135
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,133
But yeah, I am a Linux boi.

136
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:53,129
I have switched back to Windows for some days,

137
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:58,995
but then I switched BACK to Linux because I got familiar with Kubuntu and Mint,

138
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:02,289
I kinda forgot how to use Windows tbh.

139
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:06,074
My biggest challenges are playing video games as some games are not supported, 

140
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:08,624
especially multi-player titles,

141
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:12,989
and softwares I might need like DaVinci Resolve that I have issues with.

142
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,807
That’s why I’m using Kdenlive to edit this video.

143
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:17,272
But even with downsides,

144
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:20,745
Linux has improved a lot since the Vista days

145
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,593
and I hope for more work to be done on it

146
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:29,356
so that people can consider it as a viable alternative to Mac or Windows…
