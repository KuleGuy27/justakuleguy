* Windows 10 is dead... but there are options!

# 
On the 14th of October 2025. Microsoft is ending their support for Windows 10 and this is a huge deal since a lot of people use Windows 10 and now tons of computers are vunerable because people will stop receiving security updates. Because of this, I wanted to make a SomeOrdinaryGamers style video to show you guys other operating systems that you can install because Windows 10 is now dead. Sorry for uploading so late, I had school work to do and my computer is too slow to long videos in general.
