* ROBLOX War of the Worlds - Becoming and Dying as a Tripod and Uberpod

# One of my favorite ROBLOX games at the moment. This game allows you to become a citizen, a military soldier, a tripod and a uberpod. There's a limit of 6 people being a tripod/uberpod as you don't want everyone to be in that tripod of course. The game tells you that the 'team is full' on a large server and I had to join a smaller server where a few people were tripod for this video.

0:00 - Becoming a tripod
3:13 - Dying as a tripod
3:45 - Becoming a uberpod
8:57 - Dying as a uberpod

Major Differences-

Tripod:
- 5000 exp (cheaper)
- smaller and faster
- has lights on the back of it's head
- weaker heatrays, but lasts longer
- white color for heatrays
- you can tell when you killed a player, screen turns blue
- different spotlights
- different horn sound
- has tendrils
- camera is better, you can look in all directions and also look up easily

Uberpod:
- 75000 exp (expensive)
- taller but slower
- no lights on the back of it's head
- stronger heatrays, but lasts shorter
- blue color for heatrays
- you can't tell when you killed a player
- different spotlights
- different horn sound
- has no tendrils
- camera is worse, difficult to look in all directions, forces you to look down in 1st person mode
