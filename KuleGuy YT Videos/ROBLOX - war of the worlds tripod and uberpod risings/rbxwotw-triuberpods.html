        One of my favorite ROBLOX games at the moment. This game allows you to become a citizen, a military soldier, a tripod and a uberpod. There's a limit of 6 people being a tripod/uberpod as you don't want everyone to be in that tripod of course. The game tells you that the 'team is full' on a large server and I had to join a smaller server where a few people were tripod for this video.
        <br></br>
        0:00 - Becoming a tripod
        <br>
        3:13 - Dying as a tripod
        <br>
        3:45 - Becoming a uberpod
        <br>
        8:57 - Dying as a uberpod
        <br></br>
        Major Differences-
        <br></br>
        Tripod:
        <br>
        - 5000 exp (cheaper)
        <br>
        - smaller and faster
        <br>
        - has lights on the back of it's head
        <br>
        - weaker heatrays, but lasts longer
        <br>
        - white color for heatrays
        <br>
        - you can tell when you killed a player, screen turns blue
        <br>
        - different spotlights
        <br>
        - different horn sound
        <br>
        - has tendrils
        <br>
        - camera is better, you can look in all directions and also look up easily
        <br></br>
        Uberpod:
        <br>
        - 75000 exp (expensive)
        <br>
        - taller but slower
        <br>
        - no lights on the back of it's head
        <br>
        - stronger heatrays, but lasts shorter
        <br>
        - blue color for heatrays
        <br>
        - you can't tell when you killed a player
        <br>
