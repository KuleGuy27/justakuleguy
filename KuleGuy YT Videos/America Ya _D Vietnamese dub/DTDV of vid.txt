Thân hạnh xin chào bật quý khách! (I think that's what she said)

I got this clip from: https://archive.org/details/azumanga-daioh-htv3-dub
It's episode 19 (13 minutes and 48 seconds in)
In the original Japanese version, it's episode 20 (14 minutes and 35 seconds in), that's because the Vietnamese dub cut out episode 4.

This clip can also be found on YouTube, uploaded by other Vietnamese people:
