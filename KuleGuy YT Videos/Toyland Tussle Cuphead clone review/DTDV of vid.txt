* Toyland Tussle! - An Actually Good Cuphead Clone??? (Review)

#
Cuphead is one of my most favorite video games I've ever played and throughout the years, there have been clones or copies of it, and those clones quite frankly suck. A few weeks ago, Shaconda Cartoons (a channel I'm subscribed to), made a video on Toyland Tussle and that's how I found out about the game. It's essentially another Cuphead clone with the same artstyle and I'm impressed at how good it is to the other clones and that 1 person made the entire game by themselves.
Here is my review on "Toyland Tussle" and I hope you enjoy the video!
