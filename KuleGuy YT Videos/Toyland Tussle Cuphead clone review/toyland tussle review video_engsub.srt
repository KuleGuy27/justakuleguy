1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,081
In 2017,

2
00:00:01,106 --> 00:00:03,548
Studio MDHR released Cuphead,

3
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:05,160
one of the best games I’ve ever played.

4
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:07,622
It’s a 2D animated run and gun action game

5
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:09,716
where you defeat around 20 bosses

6
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:12,850
so that you can gain soul contracts and also beat the Devil.

7
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:16,162
The unique thing and what I was drawn to when I first saw this game

8
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:17,920
was the look or animation of it.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,559
It’s based on “rubber hose” animations from the 1930s

10
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:23,278
with every frame being hand drawn

11
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:26,904
and then scanned onto a computer to color it and then code it,

12
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,273
which is just next level.

13
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,218
Nice job team!

14
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:35,620
Since 2017, Studio MDHR also released a DLC called the “Delicious Last Course”.

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,491
Haha, get it?

16
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:39,750
And it’s also pretty good, adding more weapons and charms to the game.

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,628
As for the gameplay, it’s pretty fun,

18
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:45,341
but it gets pretty challenging at times because there’s a lot going on screen

19
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,310
and you have to use the right amount of skill to dodge attacks.

20
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,469
I’ve even heard people compare this game to Dark Souls for some reason.

21
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:55,505
You can play the game as Mugman or Ms. Chalice if you have the DLC

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,017
and you can also play the game in 2 player mode with a friend as well.

23
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,342
Cuphead is one of my top 5 games out there

24
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:04,519
and I give it a 10/10 just because I personally love it.

25
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,086
It’s an amazing game with an old-ish artstyle,

26
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,615
a really good musical score,

27
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,044
and engaging gameplay that I can never get bored of.

28
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,994
Seriously, go check it out if you haven’t,

29
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,126
and there’s also a Netflix show about it too which is pretty neat.

30
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:17,681
Now with anything that’s popular,

31
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:19,166
there’s always gonna be copies of it,

32
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,434
and Cuphead is no different.

33
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:23,712
The first clone of Cuphead I heard about is “Enchanted Portals”.

34
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:26,416
This is a game marketed as being Cuphead inspired,

35
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:30,877
being the most popular clone of Cuphead with people still referencing it to this day.

36
00:01:30,902 --> 00:01:31,941
As for the plot,

37
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:36,085
it’s about 2 Harry Potter wizards accidentally stumbling upon a book,

38
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,536
they cast spells on it,

39
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:40,658
and then they get sucked into another world and fight bosses.

40
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,898
Now I have never played the game, but looking at reviews of it on YouTube,

41
00:01:43,923 --> 00:01:48,676
the art is pretty nice but the game just doesn't feel as polished and as smooth as Cuphead is.

42
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:49,427
3 out of 10.

43
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:52,355
“Rubber Hose Rampage” is another game that comes to mind.

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,224
I found this game because of a Pogobro and boy oh boy is it bad.

45
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,726
The game is in black and white,

46
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,195
the animation isn’t smooth,

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,417
and most of it is traced on really old cartoons anyways.

48
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:06,212
Some bosses are impossible to beat, and it just screams poor quality.

49
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:10,293
The game did get updated by adding more bosses and color into the game,

50
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:11,797
but it’s still a piece of garbage.

51
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:12,760
1 out of 10.

52
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:15,003
CHICKEN JOCKEY

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:23,154
God Bless The USA

54
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,279
It's time for the moment you've been waiting for!

55
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:26,927
Duh...

56
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,660
Duh (x7)

57
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,911
Duh (x15)

58
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,343
I don't want to sub all this, you know the point.

59
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,515
Spongebob Seasons 1-3 was peak.

60
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,596
Alvin and the Chipmunks

61
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:39,308
I feel like P Diddy with fur

62
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:40,271
Preparing...

63
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:41,411
“Toyland Tussle”.

64
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:45,640
This is probably the best Cuphead clone ever and hence why I wanted to make this video.

65
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,404
I found this because of Shaconda Cartoons, a channel I’m subscribed to

66
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,149
and honestly, it looks pretty good.

67
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:52,909
This game was released to Steam,

68
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,363
because every video game ever is on Steam,

69
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,816
in August 2025 which is last month.

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,170
The developer is RBW games

71
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,956
and the price of it is 3 dollars.

72
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,206
Needless to say, I bought the game to see how it was and…

73
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,128
Nah I’m just kidding.

74
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:10,170
I got it from a quacked site because I don’t have any money right now, but anyways…

75
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:13,149
When you first start the game, it opens up in windowed view,

76
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:15,467
so now I have to push P to fullscreen it.

77
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:17,982
Which is pretty annoying, but it's a minor inconvenience.

78
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,003
In the main menu,

79
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:23,170
I didn't know which button to press to select the items, so I used my controller.

80
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:25,671
This game has controller support btw and it's fine.

81
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:31,175
Eventually, I found out that you press the ‘spacebar’ to select the items and ‘enter’ to go back.

82
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:36,816
Anyways, the stats menu allows you to change the film to a ‘color’ or a ‘black and white’ filter,

83
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,482
and a menu to view the guns.

84
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:42,993
Press ‘A’ on your controller and ‘enter’ on your keyboard to go back to the main menu.

85
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:47,530
The controls menu tells you which button to press and you can change it to another preset.

86
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:50,956
Unfortunately it doesn't let you rebind or remap the keys,

87
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,949
you are stuck at whatever the game gives you.

88
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:56,512
Pressing play gives you the difficulty of standard or extreme,

89
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,926
and whichever one you click,

90
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,918
it will showcase you the plot of the story.

91
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:01,301
So as a plot goes,

92
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,810
the main character is called “Fodder the Cannon”.

93
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:06,935
He was walking downtown wanting to spend his money on something,

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,255
then he saw a small toystore and proceeded to walk inside.

95
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,310
In the store, there's a music box on a pedestal and because of curiosity,

96
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:18,677
he decided to open the box and then he got sucked into a world made of toys.

97
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:22,902
He gets jumpscared by this monkey or whatever, and then the game starts.

98
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:23,888
So here is the boss!

99
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:25,685
This game only has one boss battle

100
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,083
and it doesn't have a name so I don't know what to call this.

101
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,958
In the first phase, you fight the guy who just jumpscared you.

102
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:32,625
He does 3 attacks and it's either:

103
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,412
a streak of lightning across the floor,

104
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:35,897
the clapping of his symbols,

105
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,440
or music notes that falls down.

106
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:39,402
When you die, there's a death screen, saying:

107
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:42,503
"Ha! I knew you would lose, even if there was a hundred of you's!”

108
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:45,994
Probably a reference to the 100 men vs 1 gorilla thing.

109
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,226
And it gives you the option to retry the level,

110
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,485
exit to the main menu,

111
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,838
or equip another weapon.

112
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:51,849
Speaking of which,

113
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,338
there are four weapons, being the:

114
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,848
bullet, firework, bounce bomb, and splitter.

115
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:57,703
The bullet is the first weapon that you get.

116
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,062
It's basically just like the peashooter in Cuphead,

117
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:03,084
shooting in a straight line and it's EX is a bigger bullet.

118
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:05,076
The firework is like the chaser in Cuphead,

119
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:09,407
it homes onto the enemy but with the EX being a ring moving in a circular pattern.

120
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:11,507
This one has the least amount of damage at 1.

121
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:15,071
The bounce bomb reminds me of the lobber but it shoots across the screen

122
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,196
and it's EX is 6 bigger bombs bouncing across the screen.

123
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,130
This has the most amounts of damage at 4

124
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,253
Finally the splitter,

125
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:25,511
it shoots in both the front and back of your head and the EX is 2 bigger spears.

126
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:27,230
Not sure why you would need this weapon though.

127
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,956
In the second phase, you deal with two monkeys that either:

128
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,497
spits out peanuts from their mouth,

129
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:33,958
throw a coconut that splits into 2 pieces,

130
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,883
or throw out their head that bounces from the floor back to them.

131
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:40,581
There's even a banana that walks across the screen to make it even harder.

132
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,765
Embarrassingly, I died a lot on this phase because there was so much stuff going on

133
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,250
and I couldn't dodge quick enough.

134
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,190
Even as the chimpanzees, they can see that I'm the real monkey.

135
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,857
But after a couple of tries, I got to phase 3.

136
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,613
In phase 3, the monkey from the start reveals himself in a bigger form

137
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,478
and he does 3 attacks once again.

138
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:59,292
Stretching his hand out to punch me,

139
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,510
shooting barrels into the sky that falls down,

140
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:04,140
or a banana that shoots in 6 directions

141
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,914
that you have to dodge very quick before you lose your health.

142
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,654
Eventually, I got to beat him,

143
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,940
or maybe he beats himself,

144
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,532
and I got a bronze ranking!

145
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:14,809
Apparently this guy is nice and I just beat him up for no reason.

146
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,614
I take a walk into a portal,

147
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,311
get sucked back to reality,

148
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,165
somebody screams at me to get away,

149
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,553
and I learned a very valuable lesson that day.

150
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:23,698
Spelled wrong by the way.

151
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:25,599
And that was it, only one boss!

152
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:26,610
In the credits screen,

153
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:30,221
we learn that RBW stands for Raz Bennett-Warner,

154
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:33,385
and this person did all work on the game, which is impressive.

155
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,466
He thanks his family and friends and then us for playing the game.

156
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:37,205
You're welcome.

157
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,830
And that's it!

158
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,483
I give my compliments to the chef.

159
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,454
As for what I like about Toyland Tussle,

160
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,747
the animation is pretty good.

161
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:47,634
It looks like it’s based on Cuphead with it having the same style and the old grainy filter.

162
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,880
Unlike the other clones,

163
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:51,120
the animation is pretty smooth and polished,

164
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,424
and I personally haven't found any bugs yet.

165
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,204
The music and sound effects are fine,

166
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,024
you can view the OST on the Official YouTube channel.

167
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,683
I feel like it can be improved,

168
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,154
but I'm not a game developer

169
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:05,177
and I'll cut RBW some slack because it's only one person behind it.

170
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:08,042
Gameplay wise, it's pretty fun and challenging to play

171
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,017
and somewhat difficult just like Cuphead.

172
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:13,337
I like the attacks that the bosses give you and it's pretty creative.

173
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:15,090
For things that I don't like however,

174
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,152
it sucks that you can't rebind your keys.

175
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:21,232
Doing that would probably help me defeat the bosses easier by keeping my muscle memory.

176
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:22,313
There's just no option.

177
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:25,099
Speaking of that, there's no settings in the game either.

178
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:28,658
You can't change your resolution or volume level like in other games.

179
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:32,534
Another pet peeve that I have is that the game doesn't tell me what to press,

180
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,426
like “spacebar” to select or “enter” to the pause screen.

181
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:36,467
Speaking of which,

182
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:40,217
there's no resume button so I kept replaying the boss on accident.

183
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:43,615
There's also no tutorial on how to play the game for newcomers.

184
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:46,228
But most people know this game as the “Cuphead Clone”

185
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:48,788
and most people already know how Cuphead works.

186
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,232
Finally, there's only one boss battle in the game,

187
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:54,695
with nothing else to explore and it can get pretty boring after a while.

188
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,524
Besides that,

189
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:59,201
this game has a lot of potential being a very good fan-game or clone to Cuphead,

190
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:02,642
and if the developer ever updates an adds more stuff in the game,

191
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,530
I'll definitely replay it in the future.

192
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,818
We will watch your career with great interest.

193
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:07,695
As for my rating,

194
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,603
I'll give it a 7 out of 10 because it’s pretty decent

195
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,022
but it only has 1 boss.

196
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,483
It’s probably the best Cuphead clone I’ve ever seen.

197
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,306
No game comes close to this.

198
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,582
Looking back at the script,

199
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,066
I forgot to mention Acecraft.

200
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,060
The game is good,

201
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:21,306
the bosses are pretty cool

202
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,029
and it has somewhat of a storyline,

203
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,414
but it’s only for mobile and it has some micro-transactions,

204
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,398
so I’ll give it a 6 out of 10.

205
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:29,144
But yeah,

206
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,080
Toyland Tussle has a lot of potential

207
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,263
and I hope there are more developments to the game.

208
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:34,808
Go check it out if you haven’t,

209
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,229
and I’ll see you next time.

210
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:36,880
Bye!

211
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,879
Me after getting 99 instead of 100 on test.
