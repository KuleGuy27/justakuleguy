Everytime a new YT video is made:
- Make a folder with the topic of your blog
- make a folder in Abyss.to and upload your videos there (if necessary)
- upload to internet archive too
- copy, create, or download any images and videos you see fit
- make a blog.html file

 - in the blog list (index), copy and paste the article tag and edit the: link, h2 (make title), image, h3 (edit tags), and p (edit post date).

- in the blog posts itself; edit the site title from the folder, h1 (from h2 index), h3 date, video source, h3 description, link url with "a href" if possible
- add downloadable links to donwload the .srt subtitles + add a mirror link
- link to mirrors (YouTube, Odysee, Rumble, Internet Archive)
